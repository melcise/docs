The nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained networks such as 6LoWPAN often have high packet error rates and a typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s. The protocol is designed for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation.\nCoAP provides a request/response interaction model between application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and Internet media types. CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP for integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead and simplicity for constrained environments.\nFor more information on the CoAP protocol see [RFC7252](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252).\n","preview":"<p>This api is currently released as a beta and may be updated at any time.</p>\n"},{"path":"/coap/#timeseries-data-procedures","title":"CoAP -> CoAP API -> Procedures -> Timeseries Data Procedures","body":"[Write](#write) - write new data to a set of dataports\n[Read](#read) - read the latest data from a set of dataports\n[Observed Read](#observed-read) - be notified immediately when a dataport is updated\n[Multiple Read and Write](#multiple-read-and-write) - write a set of dataports, then read a set of dataports\n","preview":"<p><a href=\"#write\">Write</a> - write new data to a set of dataports</p>\n"},{"path":"/coap/#provisioning-procedures","title":"CoAP -> CoAP API -> Procedures -> Provisioning Procedures","body":"[Activate](#activate) - activate device and get device's CIK\n[List Content IDs](#list-content-ids) - get a list of content available to device\n[Get Content Info](#get-content-info) - get meta information about content file\n[Download Content](#download-content) - get content file\n","preview":"<p><a href=\"#activate\">Activate</a> - activate device and get device&#39;s CIK</p>\n"},{"path":"/coap/#utility-procedures","title":"CoAP -> CoAP API -> Procedures -> Utility Procedures","body":"[Timestamp](#timestamp) - get the current unix timestamp\n[Remote Procedure Call Proxy](#remote-procedure-call-proxy) - proxy CBOR-RPC calls to the [JSON-RPC](/rpc) API\n","preview":"<p><a href=\"#timestamp\">Timestamp</a> - get the current unix timestamp</p>\n"},{"path":"/coap/#libraries-and-sample-code","title":"CoAP -> CoAP API -> Libraries and Sample Code","body":"A sample CoAP client written in python is available in the [CoAPExample](https://github.com/exosite-garage/CoAPExample) repository.\n","preview":"<p>A sample CoAP client written in python is available in the <a href=\"https://github.com/exosite-garage/CoAPExample\">CoAPExample</a> repository.</p>\n"},{"path":"/coap/#notational-conventions","title":"CoAP -> CoAP API -> Notational Conventions","body":"This document uses a few notational conventions:\nA name in angle brackets, e.g. `<myvar>`, is a placeholder that will be defined elsewhere.\nCoAP request packets are shown in a text format with the format `METHOD: URI\\nPAYLOAD`.\n","preview":"<p>This document uses a few notational conventions:</p>\n"},{"path":"/coap/#coap-responses","title":"CoAP -> CoAP API -> CoAP Responses","body":"CoAP makes use of so called CoAP Response Codes which resemble the HTTP status codes defined in [RFC7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6) plus some CoAP-specific status codes.

Long polling is a method of getting a server push without the complexities of setting up publicly accessible HTTP server endpoints on your device. As the name suggests, long polling is similar to normal polling of an HTTP resource, but instead of requiring the client to make a new request to the server constantly, the server will wait to return until it has new information to return to the client (or a timeout has been reached).\nTo perform a request with long polling simply add the header `Request-Timeout: <miliseconds>` to your request. The server will then wait until a new datapoint is written to the given dataport and will then immediately return the value. If no datapoint is written before that time a `304 Not Modified` is returned and the client may make another long poling request to continue monitoring that dataport.\nYou may also optionally add an `If-Modified-Since` header to specify a start time to wait. This is exactly the same as the `alias.last` semantics in scripting. You will want to use this if it's important that you receive all updates to a given dataport, otherwise it is possible to miss points that get written between long polling requests.\nNote: Only one dataport may be read at a time when using long polling.\nGET /onep:v1/stack/alias?<alias 1> HTTP/1.1\nHost: m2.exosite.com\nX-Exosite-CIK: <CIK>\nAccept: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8\nRequest-Timeout: <timeout>\nIf-Modified-Since: <timestamp>\n<blank line>\n`<alias>` is the alias you monitor for new datapoints.\n`Request-Timeout` specifies the how long to wait on changes.  `<timeout>` is a millisecond value and cannot be more than 300 seconds (300000 ms).\n`If-Modified-Since` specifies waiting on aliases since the `<timestamp>`.  `<timestamp>` can be timestamp seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC or standard <a href=http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html>HTTP-Date</a> format.

When it is vital for your application to receive all updates to a dataport, you can pass the `Last-Modified` header value back to the `If-Not-Modified-Since` header in your next request to make sure that you don't miss any points that may have been written since the last request returned.\n$ curl http://m2.exosite.com/onep:v1/stack/alias?<dataport-alias> \\\n    -H 'X-Exosite-CIK: <CIK>' \\\n    -H 'Accept: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8'\n    -H 'Request-Timeout: 30000\n    -H 'If-Modified-Since: 1408088308\n","preview":"<p>The <a href=\"#read\">read</a> procedure now supports long polling.
